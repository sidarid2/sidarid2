The game of Roulette is a standard casino game whereby a croupier spins a wheel in one direction, then spins a ball in the
opposite direction around a tilted circular track running around the outer edge of the wheel. The ball eventually loses momentum
and settles into one of thirty-eight colored and numbered pockets. See the image below for a picture of the wheel (left side) and
the game board where patrons will make bets (right side)
